<h3>🔹 Methodology</h3>

Generated and processed synthetic satellite datasets simulating mangrove and non-mangrove regions.

Engineered key vegetation and water indices (NDVI, NDWI) for effective feature representation.

Developed and evaluated machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine for pixel-based classification.

Produced interactive geospatial visualizations, including choropleth maps, prediction probability maps, and spectral signature comparisons.

Integrated geospatial coordinates to analyze mangrove coverage across regions.


<h3>🔹 Key Findings</h3>

Random Forest achieved the highest performance (~92% accuracy) on synthetic data, demonstrating strong classification capability.

Spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI) effectively differentiate mangrove areas from other land cover types.

Visualizations revealed spatial patterns of mangrove coverage, highlighting ecologically significant regions.

Synthetic data can provide reliable training for ML models when real-world datasets are limited.
